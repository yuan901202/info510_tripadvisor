(somewhadissapointing) - for other cruise companies, we saw some compaints aboufriendlyness. with regardso friendlyness ofhe staff, we didn'have anythingo compain abouonhis cruise. iis interestingo knowhoughhamilford is so remotehapeople working in milford stay/live in milford. resulting inhe fachamosstaff (acrosshe various cruise companies) will know eachother and liveogether, and (although i am nosure ofhis) will be interchangeable. in other words, if you have bad luck with a staff member nobeing friendly, icould jusbe his/her off day, obviously none ofhe cruises will hire peoplehaare unfriendly on purpose.two more somewhageneralips:tryo keep an eye onhe weather, and especially during high season, book a cruise a couple days in advance (if you can) ashis will prevendissapointmenwith booked ouships. if you have a car yourself, do nospend money on having a bus drive youo milford. the drive overhere is beautiful andhere are many stops onhe way, some of which are noeven accessibleoourbusses. make sure you schedule in enoughimeo gehere (minimum ,/ hours from te anau withoustops).to sum iup: the 'cruise milford' was nice, buin my opiniono expensive for whayou get. nexime i would go with a cheaper alternative.milford itself is amazing!!

"4762","i've reviewedhis araction before and all crediohe management,hey did acon several of my comments. ok, sohey can'do much abouhe view ofhe lake (or lack of) until finances allow, and i hopehey do allow sometime soon because a view would be great. thisimehe place was packed with summer holiday people. iwas a hoday and i was worriedhahe pools would beoo hot. noo fear,hey had reducedheemperature. we noticedo our concernhahe boom pool was closed inhe middle ofhe busy afternoon and everyone was squeezed intowo pools. i asked when iwould be open andhey said  minutes. good onhemhaiopened inen! people spread ouand had a goodime. they've added some 'rock' seats and have removedheay umbrellas. the centre pool has been repainted and allhe pools were safely lifeguarded. my only grumble would behe state ofhe changing rooms - again! there was mess everywhere and iwas yukky. buagain, all crediohe managemenhaas soon as i mentioned it,hey sencleaners inhere. well done onhe improvements.","joy","neutral"
