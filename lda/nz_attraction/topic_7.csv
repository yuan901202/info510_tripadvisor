"2697","exploring milford sound was supposedo behe highlighof our experience in queenstown, and iwas very good. however,here are a few importanhings we'd likeo share.first, i will prefacehis by sayinghawe visited during spring -he weather is unpredictable and whalookedo be a nice dayurned ouo be a very weand cold one indeed. nonetheless, we did have quite a good experience kayaking milford sound andhinkhaultimately iwashe beswayo do milford sound (vs a cruise). we did nogeo see as much wildlife as wehoughwe would, and so ended up looking ahe cliffs and waterfalls a lo(which are beautiful bubecome a birepetitive), buhat's nowhy i'm dinginghe review. the only reason we would nogive rosco's a -star review is because ofhe airline operatorhey partner with forheir 'fly-kayak-fly' option. they partner with glenorchy air (who we'll review separately), buwould caution strongly any potential patronsohink carefully abouhe circumstances of yourrip before selecting any ""flying"" option. to make a long-story short, we ended up havingoake a coach backoown ratherhan fly as we had planned (and paid for) - and whilehis in and of itself is nohaavoidable,he experience dealing withhe operator and every other singlehing abouhem was juserrible.in any case, backo rosco's.highlights: - really really friendly, knowledgeable and fun guides. we had ricky, buhey were all great.- groups are prey small - maybe abou- people or - kayaks per group, so experience is personal - milford sound is breathtaking, andaking iin via kayak ihink is a really good wayo experience whatever wild lifehere is. for example, we saw a fur seal jushanging ouon a ledge aone point.here is no way you can seehafrom a cruise ship. we also saw some playing inhe water and goo go checkhem out. can'dohafrom a cruise ship.- rosco's provides everything -hermals, spray skirt, fleece, rain coat, hats, etc. so you don'really need anything in particular.minor criticisms: - as mentioned, we didn'see as much wildlife as wehought.he website shows penguins, seals - ihink mentions dolphinsoo. ihink ireally depends onhe weather,ime of year, and your luck, buwe only saw a few seals inotal. noa bighing, buwe jushad a differenexpectation. i wouldn'go in expectingo see a loof animals. -he sound / fjord is beautiful, buif you are doing a shorkayak (like  hours or so), you won'geo see as much as you would flying over ioraking a cruisehrough it. ihinkhe beswayo gehe besof both worlds would beo (weather depending)ake a flighhere and back (which is stunning) and kayakhere. we ended up kayaking only one lile parofhe sound - going up one side andhenurning around and coming back onhe opposite side -he website should be updated - iseems a lile inconsistenwith whaactually happens. for example, ilists allhehings you should bring onherip - like gear, food, etc. buhat's a lile differenfrom whayou actually get. so everyone showed up wearing differenstuff, and unclear whawas supposedo happen. in spring, when it's cold, you will gehermals, a spray skir(for your kayak), a fleece, a rain coaand ha(all if you wanhem -hey suggesyouakehem sohayour own clothes don'geweand you can change later). i was wearing swimmingrunks, buyou don'needhabecause mosofheimehe spray skirshould keep your entire boom half dry. you should juswear regular clothes with underwear and puyourhermal overhat,hen wear whatever you wanonop and puonheir rain coat. i broughmy own hat. they don'give you gloves likehe say buit's noreally needed. for shoes - don'wear sandals or weshoes - you won'geweand iwill be cold - juswear shoes,hey will stay dry inhe kayak. you will all changeogether inhis big heatedent, so my wife adviseso wear undergarmentshaare more or less noembarassing. for food - we never had a formal 'stop' for lunch and you jushaveo findimeo snack if you wanit.-he website also sayshahe paddlingime forhe 'fly-kayak-fly'rip was  hours - buhawas norigh- ihinkhaisheotalime. iseems likehey have a bunch of differenpeople who juswano kayak andheyakehem all ouogether and everyone is oufor abou- hours. ididn'seem likehere were differenypes of kayak adventures ashe website seemedo intimate, buhamay behe case inhe summer.in any case, overall, a very good experience. i would definitely recommend for anyone who is interestedory and make surehe weather is cooperating. spring is noa badime, buif you wano flyhere and back, make well sure you know whayou could be in for. ilefa very very badaste in our mouths.","joy","neutral"

"4945","iwas a very long day ( hours from pick-upill drop-off) buwas well worth iand much beerhanryingo driveo milford sound ourselves. the coach driver jesse was very personable and informative.we were slightly disappointed and surprised by a fewhings. we had bookedhe more expensive coach-cruise-coach option because we were keeno go inhe glass-topped coach and have reclining seats (and an on boardoilet). unfortunately, as we are a family of four and we were some ofhe laspeopleo boardhe bus,he only four seatsogether were righuphe back, where of coursehe seats would norecline andhe benefiofhe glass roof was minimalo none (the glass roof stops juspashalf-way downhe bus). the jucy website and alsoravel/araction brochures all advertise free wifi on board, and despite usrying severalimes on several differendevices, we found no such wifi. i had promisedhe kidshey would have a chanceo go online asome stage duringhe day and iwas disappointinghahis was nohe case. also, many people onhe bus had paidhe lower amounandhe only difference we could see washasome people (us included) had lunch included and others did not. whilshere was nothing aall wrong withhe lunch provided, iwas hardly worthhe amounof extra money we paid. i strongly advise othershinking of bookingo go forhe cheaper option because you mighend up geinghe beer bus etc anyway and even if you don't, iisn'worthhe extra money forhe luxury deal. the cruise of milford sound was a beautiful experience. we were extremely fortunate withhe weather and we could see everything very clearly. ilooks like a poscard and is something noo be missed in my opinion. going underhe waterfall was very cool (literally forhose few who stood uphe fronand wantedo gewet) andhe kids especially seemedo enjoyhapart. we also saw fur seals onhe rocks, andhe boadriver made sure he stayedhere long enougho allow everyone a good look. if you wano cruise milford sound (and you should definitely do it!), i definitely recommend a coach-cruise-coach option such ashis. the road is long and winding and you wano be ableoake inhe views and nohaveo concentrate onhe roads. we are very glad we did it! my advice ifhinking of booking with jucy iso ) go forhe cheaper option for reasons stated above and ) ask abouhe wifi before you promise io your kids! ;)","joy","neutral"
