"236","myself and a friend (both certified divers) recently wenfor a guided shallow shore dive around goaisland. the weather had nobeen greafor a few days,herefore ocean conditions were nooptimal buour guide ashleigh was ableo lead us on a greadive.theeam ahe dive center all seemed really friendly. the check-in process was simple however i was a lile surprisedhaalthough we wrote down a certification number of a piece of paper our actual dive certifications or details were never actually seen or checked. to her credit, ashleighookheimeo ask allhe divers abouheir prior dive experience so ihink she could have been relatively confidenin our abilities despite noformally checking for a certification.we didn‚äôbring any dive gear with us so ashleigh picked ousome rental gear for us. the equipmenwasop quality and in greacondition. the wetsuits were a welcome .mm,he bcds all had integrated weights andhe open heel fins and boots were also very welcome as imadehe shore entry much easier.ashleigh‚äôs dive briefing was very informative and focused on giving a loof information onhe marine lifeo be found inhe area. i appreciatedhis since i normally dive inropical waters, so iwas interestingo find ouwhawe should be looking for here in new zealand.the dive we did was a shallow shore dive, buistarts with a few minutes of surface swim. unfortunately iseemed like snorkels were noregularly offered as iwould have been niceo have one forhis surface swim ratherhan havingo stay on my back. i‚äôm sure if you ask for a snorkelhey would probably be happyo provide one, sohis is whai will do if i head back.duringhe dive ashleigh was ableoake care ofhe group of  very well despitehe poor visibility. she was also ableo poinousome highlights such as an eagle ray, moray eel and crayfish. throughouhe afternoon she exhibited an enthusiastic and professional style which madehe dive feel enjoyable and safe.afterhe dive we wereoldhahere were no showering facilities available, so iwas a lile uncomfortable spendinghe resofhe afternoon feeling a lile crusty fromhe salwater. i imaginehis is less of a problem if you are staying in a nearby hotel, buwe were actually up on a dayrip from auckland. iwould be greao see if a fewweaks could be madeohe dive center so iwould beer refleche friendly and helpful staff workinghere.onehing we really appreciated ishahe friendly staffook care of all ofhe equipment, includinghe cleaning. the staff were all on hando help each other move ouranks makinghings easy and convenienfor us as customer. they were also happyo help me ouby lending some silicone grease for my underwater camera, which was very appreciated.one finalhingo note ishahere on trip advisorhe description ofhe dive center is a ‚äúpadi  star dive center‚äù, buhis is no longerhe case ashey haveransitionedo becoming an ssi dive center. therefore if padi  star if importano youhen you mighneedo see ifhere are any other options.","joy","positive"
