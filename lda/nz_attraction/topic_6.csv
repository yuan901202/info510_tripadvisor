"2644","myself and my husband wereravelling aroundhe world and during our new zealandour with stray bus, skydiving was mentioned on several occasions. we heard from a friend we mein australia aboufox glacier skydivehaiishe besinhe world, so my husband decidedo do ionce we arrive in new zealand. i always said-his onehing, is nofor me and will never be. i was prey firm withhastatement, until all our friends on aour started saying how amazing iwas whenhey skydived asome other locations. thehoughof doing it, started growing in me, buvery quietly. i jusnever imagined being ableo jump offhe plane and i was also worried whawould have happenedo my family if something happenedo me,hey would jusbe miserable, so iwould jusbe selfish if i jump. i had allhe dark scenarios in my head and i know now,his is morehan natural before your firsime... of skydiving of course‚ä¶ a day before, i started researching how safe skydiving is; how often do accidents happen and whaarehe chancehaparachute may noopen. i found ouhaskydiving accidents are much less commonhan road accidents and it‚äôs more probableo die inhe car accidenhan when skydiving. if i remember well,here is only one accidenfor ,-, skydives, meaninghe chances are extremely slim. thapersuaded me. i also found ouhafox glacier is rated ashe besskydive inhe world on many lists (one ofhem being lonely planebook guides), sometimes coming up second after mouneverest! mouneverescosof skydive was abou$,hough! when i sawhafor myselfhaiishe mospicturesque and beautiful skydive inhe world, ihought, if i amo do it,his ishe place. wehoughwe would do ion monday, so when we arrived aour hostel on sunday late afternoon, we wereold by our guide, iis goingo happenoday,hey will pick you up in  minutes! wow,hawas fast! i felnoentirely ready, buhen i knew i would be as ready any other day. they picked us up from our hostel in franz joseph and drove uso fox glacier. they welcomed us enthusiastically and very personally, which was really nice. theyold us of differenjump options, depending onhe heighwe wantedo do. we chose ,meters and my husband goa combo pack of video or photography. there were  of us skydiving. all instructors were really lovely, funny and reassuring. when we goready and after shorbusufficieninstructions whao do before we skydive and how we should behave inhe air, we goonhe plane. theyook only  of us in one plane andwo other people in another plane. my husband washe firso jump and his instructor sawith him onhe plane ledge for abou- minutes andhen he was out! my instructor push usohe ledge and we disappeared inhe air in noime, i had even noimeo look down and quite honestly, i did noeven look down aall. i did a ‚äúbanana‚äù position and we started flying. from now, i was noeven scared anymore! this washe mosamazing feeling andhe views were jusspectacular. we could seehe ocean, rivers, fox glacier and franz joseph glacier. we could see mouncook and many other mountains and lakes. we could see fields and forests. there is nothing you could nosee from here andhis is when i realised, we chosehe beslocationo skydive inhe world! i even forgoaboumy fear abouparachute noopening and when iopened andhe free-fall stopped, ihen realised, i had no fear anymore fromhe momenwe stepped/jumped offhe plane. iwas a fascinating experience and if i could do it-he person who neverhoughwould do it- everybody can! when we were flying with a parachute opened, we hadimeo look around and our instructors allowed uso controlhe parachute, which is nocommon in other skydive centres, which i found oulater from our friends. iwas greao controlhe parachute and steer iohe lefand right. i usually gearavel sickness buhad no issues aall, as i informed my instructor abouiand heookhainto accounwhen we were falling. i also was worried abouequalisation, as i had some issues when diving inhe ocean, buwhen you fly, remembero swallow a loand your ears will be fine. i was fine. when we were approachinghe earth,he feeling was amazing. iis faswhen you land, bui rememberedhe instructors sayinghafaster landing is safer, so i had no fear aall. we landed on our feeso softly;he whole experience was jusincredible! i would likeo sayhamy husband‚äôs combo pack was amazing. icosnzd  and he gosome greaquality of videos and photos and iwas worthhe money he spent. this is quite expensiveo purchase onop of your skydive, buiwas so greao see iover and over again, as when you skydive you can‚äôremember as much afterwards. therefore having video and photos will help keephe memories fresh and alive. in my opinion for high quality videos and photos, iis worth spendinghaextra money. you geion a usb memory stick. the whole experience was jusamazing andheir customer service is one ofhe besyou may ever experience even after your skydive. with your combo pack you gea free-shiroo and my husband needed xl andhey didn‚äôhave any, sohey promisedo bring ioverhe following day!
