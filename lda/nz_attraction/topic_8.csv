in okarito, hopefully safe from predators. haaschicks areakeno a cr√®che near dunedin. all kiwi juveniles are fied with a subcutaneous chip for identification before release and birds of breeding age are fied with aransmier. the rearing centres have improved our knowledge of various aspects of kiwi life, including habits, feeding, health, disease and genetics. by allowinghe publico viewhis unique bird iraises public awareness and assists in financinghe operation. althoughhe decline ofhe critically endangered rowi and haashas been halted,he birds are still asuch precariously low numbers and confinedo a single location,hahey remain vulnerableo catastrophic events such as a sudden increase in predation, disease, fire or inbreeding. some new remote predator free sanctuaries have been

responsibility ofhe departmenof conservation with a programme called ‚äúbale for our birds‚äùorap and poison stoats and ferrets withouharming other wildlife. there is also a kiwi avoidance programme for dogs. however, in spite of allhis effort, only % ofhe kiwi population receives some protection. the other % is, forhe moment, lefo fend for itself.for protection of kiwio beruly sustainable,he
