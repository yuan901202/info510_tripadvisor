"674","i'll divide uphis review in sections for easier reading.the company fox glacier guiding seemso behe bigges(nosure ifhe only one?) operation for glacier hiking in fox glacier. their office is righinhe centre ofhe lileown, andhey have half-day and full-day hikes. they are super organized, very efficienand have mosofhe equipmenhayou will need forhe hike. the guides were very friendly, informative and entertaining. they made an efforo geo know everyone's name (there was an introduction of everyone ahe beginning), sohabyhe end of - hours you feel like you've made new friends. there are abou people inhe grouphagespliintowo smaller groups once ahe glacier parking lo(busransportation is included inhe price). we made our reservations online, awhichime we paid forheour as well, andhe email confirmation had allhe instructions oniming ofhe hike, whao bring, etc. in some cases of inclemenweather full-day hikes can be cancelled and rescheduled forhe nexday. fox glacier is inhe rain belt, so it's quite wemosofheime, especially inhe summer, so keephis in mind when booking - perhaps give yourself some flexibilityo stay afox for - days if possible. we goextremely lucky, ashere wasorrential rain forhe entire day while we were drivingo fox, andheours onhaday gocancelled because iwasn'safeo go (the glacier is surrounded by rocky mountains and heavy rains can cause rock avalanches as well as high streamshacan be hardo cross). however, onhe nexday, when our hike was reserved,he day started ousunny and beautiful bugorainy inhe afternoon (more onhalater). one couple in our group washere becauseheir hike was cancelledhe previous day.gear inhe confirmation email when you make your reservation you'll be informed of everythinghayou needo bring onhe hike. hiking boots are required - if you don'have your own,he company provideshem. i'd advise, even if you have your own bootsoakeheirs. the reason i sayhis is because in case you gecaughinhe rain (as we did), and your boots are nowaterproof, you'll gewefeet. even if your boots are waterproof (as ours were), because ofhe heavy rain onhe way back,he streams coming downhe mountains goso highhahere was no wayo crosshem buo step into knee deep water, sohis prey much guarantees your boots will gewet. this may nobe a problem for some people, buif you're planningo hikehe nexday or even later inhe day, keep in mindhayour boots may nogedry inime (it's very damp in fox).crampons are also provided and you'll be shown howo puhem on once ahe glacier. you have a choice ofaking a walking stick as well. theemperature onhe glacier is abou degrees lowerhan inheown, so bring appropriate clothing. the company provides miens, hats and waterproof over-pants. you'll also need a waterproof jacket. for full-day hikers, bring a lunch (you'll geone break for lunch onhe glacier - cooleshing ever!), some snacks and water. also make surehayour backpacks are waterproof or aleasmake surehayou puyour stuff in a waterproof bag insidehe backpack, jusin case you gecaughinhe rain.the hikes we didhe full-day hike, which is considerably more expensive, buiwas worth every penny, and ihink i would have been disappointing inhe half-day hike having been onhe full-day one. the half-day hikers geo only goohe base ofhe glacier, hang oufor a bit, andhen go back, whereashe full-day hikers go deep intohe glacier - how deep depends onhe day andhe weather, and a lile bionhe guide. ourwo groups didn'akehe same route, so we weren'in each others' way (which was nice because ididn'feel crowded), buwe ended up seeinghe same parts ofhe glacier. aheime we visitedhere was a new route being explored bubecause ofhe rainshe previous day, our guide wasn'sure how safe iwasoake it, so we ended upakinghe older route. sincehe ice moves and changes allheime, i'd presumehamospeople see slightly differenhings. the guide is in fronof everyone else and clearshe path with his ice axe, as needed, making steps or grooves inhe ice so you can walk. there are partshaare steep and require you hold onto a rope. sometimeshe guide would checkhe bolts holdinghe ropeso make surehey are secure, and you may haveo standhere waiting. they are very safety oriented, so you won'mind :) there are many ice holeshajuslook like holesohe abyss, and your guide will show youhese buwarn youo stay well back. you haveo make sure you followhe guides steps exactly and noveer ofhe pathoo much because he knowshe safesway up and avoids any questionable surfaces. the whole full-day hike lasted abou- hours. you gea break inhe middleo have lunch inhe middle ofhe glacier. afterhis, you keep venturing further intohe glacier, andhe ice gets whiter and whiter as you go in. becausehe glacier is surrounded by rocky mountains,here is a loof rocks and debris onhe ice inhe lower areas. onhe day we went,he day started ounice buhenhe clouds moved in and prey soon istarted raining prey hard (ican happenhairains ahe glacier, buidoesn'rain inown - iseemedhaonce we exitedhe glacierhe rain stopped). our guide didn'seemo heedhe rain aall, and we continued further intohe glacier. he kepcontacwithhe base constantly, andold ushaas long as he doesn'hear it's no longer safeo be onhe glacier, we will keep going because he wantedo make sure we goour money's worth. closeohe end, he finally gohe call from basehawe hadourn around, buwe ended up losing only abou minutes ofhe hike, which was ok. onhe way back we heard some loud rumblings of rocks rolling downhe mountains fromhe rain, and isounded like explosions. there werewo sections ofhe path betweenhe glacier andhe parking lohahad higher risks of falling rocks, and herehe guides will instrucyouo walk very fast, nostop and keep looking upo make surehere are no falling rock.the bus was waiting for us when we goback and drove us backoheown (this is only a  min drive). ahe end, if you wish you can gea certificate fromhe companyhayou've climbed fox glacier.overall,his glacier hiking experience is one ofhe mosspectacularhings i've ever done and i highly recommend i- it's well worthhe price.","joy","neutral"
