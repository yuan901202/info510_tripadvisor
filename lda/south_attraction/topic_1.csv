wcwc, perhapshe following may help you understandhe objectives and results achieved by wcwco date.abou years agohere were probably millions of kiwishroughouhe country. there were noerrestrial predators andhe invertebrateshahe kiwis ate, lived inhe soil. there was no reason forhe kiwio fly and ievolved into a flightless, ground dwelling bird withouaail and only vestigial wings. instead of nesting inreeshe kiwi lives in burrows. abou years agohe maori arrived as hunter gatherers with dogs andhe kiwi provided an easy source of food. buhe major problem forhe kiwi was whenhe europeans firscameo sele from abou, bringing alien predators such as dogs, cats, stoats, weasels and ferrets. inhe s stoats were introducedo control rabbits, wenferal andhrived. the opossum, introduced in , forhe meaand furrades, is also a predator by eating kiwi eggs and competing for burrows ‚äì andhere are abou million opossums living wildhroughouhe country.although endemico new zealand andhe unofficial national emblem, so lile was known abouhe kiwi populations, lifecycle and habitat,hain  icame as a shocko discoverhakiwi numbers had declinedohe poinof becoming endangered. few new zealanders have ever seen a kiwi inhe wild. iwas realisedhadrastic action hado beakeno savehe kiwi from extinction. through research, iwas estimatedhakiwi losses were abou% per year, mostlyhrough predation, with stoats identified ashe main culprits. farming and habitaloss are other contributory factorsohe decline. in he kiwi population was estimated a, and in , ,. there are  differenspecies of kiwi withhe rowi and haastokoekahe rarest. ihad been observedhastoats willake eggs and chicks bunohe larger birds. inhe wild, withouany protection, only abou% eggs hatch and perhaps only one in  ofhose reach breeding age.operation nesegg (one) was hatched in o assesshe kiwi problem and decide onhe appropriate response. as a resulin   kiwi sanctuaries were established inhe wild and  rearing centres established aauckland zoo, rotorua, whangerai, christchurch, mbruce and franz josef. the one strategy waso locate breeding pairs of kiwi inhe wild, fihem withransmiers and, ahe righime, remove any eggs for incubation ahe rearing centres ando nurturehe chicks untilhey were big enougho be released firstly into a predator free cr√®che, before finally releasinghem back intohe wild aabou year old or kg in weight. the nationalargeis , wild kiwi by  and forhe rowi,  breeding pairs.wcwc afranz josef is privately owned, in partnership withhe departmenof conservation (doc), and solely responsible for rearinghe rowi andhe haastokoeka. rowi are localo franz josef inhe , hectare okarito kiwi sanctuary, north of franz josef glacier, andhe haastokoeka are found is a small foresarea near haast. doc monitorshe breeding population of kiwi, collects eggs from wild nests and delivershemo wcwc for incubation and rearing.since  wcwc has successfully reared  rowi chicks and  haast,

in okarito, hopefully safe from predators. haaschicks areakeno a cr√®che near dunedin. all kiwi juveniles are fied with a subcutaneous chip for identification before release and birds of breeding age are fied with aransmier. the rearing centres have improved our knowledge of various aspects of kiwi life, including habits, feeding, health, disease and genetics. by allowinghe publico viewhis unique bird iraises public awareness and assists in financinghe operation. althoughhe decline ofhe critically endangered rowi and haashas been halted,he birds are still asuch precariously low numbers and confinedo a single location,hahey remain vulnerableo catastrophic events such as a sudden increase in predation, disease, fire or inbreeding. some new remote predator free sanctuaries have been identifiedo establish new populations.althoughhe sanctuaries and rearing centres have had spectacular successo date,he primary cause of kiwi decline, predation, has alsoo be addressed. this ishe responsibility ofhe departmenof conservation with a programme called ‚äúbale for our birds‚äùorap and poison stoats and ferrets withouharming other wildlife. there is also a kiwi avoidance programme for dogs. however, in spite of allhis effort, only % ofhe kiwi population receives some protection. the other % is, forhe moment, lefo fend for itself.for protection of kiwio beruly sustainable,he
