"2767","it'd been a while since i'd beeno five stags, so i was delighted when my partnerook mehere for a surprise dinner. the decor was still great,heables well laid out,he surroundings (andoilets) clean andidy. the band was excellen- a good mix of older classics and modern, andhey didheir own versions of a few songs - iwas niceo hear a band being creative.the menu had changed since my previous visits, so 'twas an opportunityory something new. i hadhe double-roasted cambridge duck; my partnerhe venison. both were superb meals -he venison was delicious and balance of flavours betweenhe duck, sauce and veges was perfect. we shared a cookies and cream cheesecake for dessert, iwas beautifuloo.previously i've reviewed five stags and given ifive stars. thisimehough, althoughhe meal was divine,here were a couple of negatives:  - they were clearly understaffed and iook over  minutes for our mealso arrive, which wasn'good enough. our waitress didn'swing by duringhe wait, so we hado goohe bar for drinkop-ups. good servicehough. - the noise level ofhe band was beyond excessive. even our waitress said so as we shouted our orderso her. we were ahe opposite end ofhe building fromhe band, withhe bar walks inhe middle, and regular conversation was impossible. the band were excellent, buseriously five stags management, you needo rethinkhe volume if you wano aracdiners. having a waitress shouyour order backo you is unprofessional.in conclusion,he excessively long waiand over-loud music did five stags no favours. thankfullyhe food was as superb as ever, and five stags remains a favourite! jusnever again on a friday evening...!","joy","positive"
