"1057","canoeing downhe whanganui river is an amazingly breathtaking adventure, you can experienceheranquility of listeningohe birdsongs andhe sound ofhe river, leinghe river guide your canoe while you relax onhe slow moving sections, and also you can enjoyhe adrenaline rush of shooting downhe rapids. we had varied weather conditions on ourrip, and we foundhaiis enjoyable both inhe sunshine andhe misty rain.the major perk ofhis greawalk ishayou don'haveo carry anything on your back, so as long as ifits inhe waterproof barrels you can bring lots of yummy food and snacks, or comfortable bedding - whatever makes your day more enjoyable. however some ofhe campsites are located quite high up with steep/slightly challenging climbs - considerhis when you haveo haul lots of barrels up ahe end ofhe day.the canoe we hired from canoe safaris is great,he backreswe requested was extremely helpful. they're based in ohakune which is nice and handy. our one complainwashawe werehe very lasgroupo be picked up ahe end. allhe other operators arrived nice and early andheir clients waited inhe buses nice and dry with hodrinks and baking. we hado waiinhe rain until our bus arrived when mosother operators have already left. we gomore wefrom waiting for our pick up ahe endhan from being onhe river. also we hado help loadhe canoes and gear inhe rain while groups with other operators waited inhe dry comforofheir buses/shules.otherhanhacanoe safaris was very professional. we felour barrels werehe optimum size for ourhings. the canoes were very comfortable and we were giving allhe information we needed for ourrip.","joy","neutral"
