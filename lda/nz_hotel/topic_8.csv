"4746","i was preparedo dislike the hermitage. places likehis, hotelsharade onheir unique location, can often be overpriced, underperforming disappointments. buthe hermitage - aleasin our experience - did a prey good job of delivering onhe promise of its undeniably spectacular location.ourwo nighstay ahe hotel was inhe depths of new zealand's winter - iwas cold and foggy when we arrived, andhe view from our room was lesshan inspirational. buhe room itself was spacious, comfortable, and well-appointed. in many nz hotels and b&bs, we competed for scarce power outlets, which were often limitedo one orwo per room. buour room athe hermitage boasted no lesshan  empty, available outlets - a veritable cornucopia of available electricity. our only complainwashahe bed linens were kind of low-end and aodds withhe overall quality ofhe room. aother hotels inhis price range, we enjoyed high qualityriple sheets and duvets, and such an amenity would be well-suitedohe otherwise aractive guesrooms athe hermitage.we enjoyed a very pleasanmeal inhe panorama restaurant, andhroughouhe hotel we experienced casually friendly service. in all, we felhe hotel was a good value, and whenhe clouds cleared on our final day,he astounding view ofhe surrounding peaks sealedhe deal for us.","joy","positive"
