"2901","ok so ive reviewed a few ofheseypes of establishments inourisvillages before and donhink i had unrealistic expectations. bui'm astounded ahe level of deceionhe menu descriptions of aleasone ofhe main meals.to be fair i will look aall aspects ofhe venue when reviewing.location: greacentral location in franz josefownship. althoughheown is small and everything is easyo geo.venue: pub feel with cosy gas heater inside and out.staff: backpackers who dory, however its obvioushey're nointerested in providing aentive service. when asked questions aboumenu or other services, iappears quite an imposition forhemo answer.menu: i orderedhe ""venison hopot"" - as described exactly onhe menu. again in fine prin- "" a venison stew in pastry accompanied with gourmepotatoes and vegetables"". ( look ahe menu inline).whai received was a pie and chips !!! seriously a dry meapie on a pile of greasy french fries with a small cup with a slice ofomato and leuce. and forhe privilege of eatinghis i was charged $. !!!!i donmind a pie and chips either buhis was a blatanrip off!i spokeohe duty manager who was a pleasanlady who asked whether any of her staff had asked me how meal was. iold her nohey had not. she appeared surprised bucould nodisagree with my poinof view regardinghe menu description.my judgemenof a restauranis generally whether i would go backhere again. my answer is no.this is blatanprice gougingourists with misleading menus.tohe landing managemen- please review your menu descriptions - people aren'stupid and shouldn'be charged upper restauranprices for low end cafe meals.ando allhe fellas looking for a good meal of venison - look elsewhere.","surprise","negative"
