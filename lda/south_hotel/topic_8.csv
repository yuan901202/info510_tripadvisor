"3835","i spen days ahe the hermitage hotel for new year  and my stay was very disappointing. the hotel has no charm, excephe exceptionnal surrondings. the room (quite expensive :  nz$ withoubreakfasfor a night) was jusvery common : basic furniture, jus beds, old tv, no computer or wifi connection. the service was also quite poor : no housekeeping before  or  pm, big confusion ahe restauran(even with a booking, i hado waifor morehan  minutes, and finally i had aable jusnexo service and cleaningable!). to sum up :he location and nothing else.","joy","negative"
"3836","our welcome was very warm upon arrival. the check-in agenwas very competenandruly personable.a few disappointments,hough:upon check-in, after a long drive, waso eainhe pub, with food balanced on our knees (noables!). we decidedo waifor aable inhe dining room, which was ""apparently full."" once we were seated, iwas obvioushahere were many emptyables. hmmmm. the food was really good and i agree withhe manager's remarkso a previous reviewer,hawe haveo keep in mind,he hotel's remote location andhe cosof bringing in fresh ingredients musbe very high. another oddity/disappointment: when you have a room with a spectacular view, and large picture window, wouldn'ibe advisableo install a bathroom vent, sohawhen you are showering, your view is nosuddenly obscured by a fogged-up window, even when all other windows are open?the staff were superb and very professional. thank you!","joy","positive"
"3837","gorgeous views weather permiing of mouncook. closeorails forrampingexpensive room rates. $ nzd. room was dates, maress old, painting chipping and roed on patio/balcony. hotel needs a major make-over ifhey are charging high prices for rooms. food is severely over-priced, and gougesourists with excessive fees for mediocre food, museum fees, star fees,perhaps stay only one night, and bring your own food dueo price gouging --they did have a monoply onhe food viaheir inclusive breakfasts/dinners) bulosvia legal proceedings as reported in nz papers. there is another restauran(indepedent) option, bubring your own food if you stay. beer off staying in twizel.","anger","negative"
