"3800","we had booked aop  floor guaranteed aoraki wing (room ) which had amazing views of mouncook. the room was spacious withwo queen size beds, a seee, an arm chair, desk and a nicely fied bathroom. we had dinner inhe intimate panorama restauranwherehe food was good andhe service very aentive. this was quite a contrasohe buffebreakfasinhe alpine restauranwherehere were very few staff, missing food or drink because ihadn’been refreshed and lots of hungry people. still,here was a huge choice ahe buffet.the hotel does cater for lots of visitors who comeo mouncook jusforhe day plus nearby motel and lodge guests andhose staying in camper vans as well ashe few hundred residents ashere is nowhere else for miles. ialways seemed busy inhe public areas and especiallyhe sir edmund hillary alpine centre café and bar. the weather was kind whilswe wereherehough you did wonder howhe hotel would cope with allhese people in bad weather.","joy","neutral"
"3801","we stayed one nighin dec.  inhe motel units which are a shorwalk fromhe main hotel. the lack of competition means all accommodation is expensive buhe unihad everything in it. we didhe hooker valley walk righupohe lake which was abou hours return. the walk is spectacular buwear good shoes ashere are a loof river bed pebbleso walk on. it's harder goinghere as it's a biuphill. the return was easier and quicker. the hermitage has a wonderful buffebreakfaswith a wonderful view of mt. cook which is all included inhe price. the only downside washe chamois restauranwhich ishe ""el cheapo"" eating place. iwas virtually deserted for dinner and i understand why. my husband had a chicken dish which was dry and stringy andhe potatoes were rock hard and inedible. i lefa complainon my motel form which was later respondedo. i didhink later we could have stayed ahe much cheaperown of twizel buhen iis aboua one nighotal experience withhe views,he quiet, and remoteness. all in allhe scenery is worthhe cost.","joy","negative"
